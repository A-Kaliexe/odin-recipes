<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>If desired, grill or sear (in a cast iron pan without oil) two of the onion quarters and two-thirds of the sliced ginger
    until well charred, about 2 minutes per cut side (this will add depth and complexity to the broth, but is optional).</li>
    <li>In a large 8-quart Dutch oven or soup pot, heat garlic-shallot oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add chopped onion
    and ginger, lemongrass, sliced garlic, lime leaves, and cilantro stems. Season lightly with salt, then cook, stirring,
    until onions are softened, about 7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add chicken to pot and top with at least 4 quarts cold water, or enough to cover. Add the 2 tablespoons kosher salt
    along with the soy sauce, fish sauce, and sugar. Bring to a simmer, then lower heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook,
    covered, for 2 hours, lifting lid occasionally to skim the surface of broth of any foam or scum that accumulates.</li>
    <li>Carefully remove chicken from the pot and transfer to a work surface (it may fall apart after this long cooking; simply
    fish out all the parts and bones). When cool enough to handle, pull meat from bones and shred with your hands or a fork.
    Discard bones and skin. Reserve chicken meat.</li>
    <li> Add chicken meat and jasmine rice back into Dutch Oven or soup pot. Simmer until rice is soft and broth has a porridge-like consistency.</li>
    <li> Serve hot, allowing guests
    garnish their soup with scallions, chiles, lime, fried garlic, fried shallots, and cilantro
    leaves and tender stems.</li>
